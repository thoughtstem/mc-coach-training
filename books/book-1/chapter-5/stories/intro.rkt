@paras{
  Welcome back to Metapolis!  We are back in early Spring, seeing the MetaCoders' classes starting up for a new session.

  The theme of this chapter is Game Mode! We'll dive in and see Games in action, as well as make another stop at Babbage University to gain a scientific perspective.  By the end of this chapter, you will also write up a game, using code, to add to your Github repo.

  On the docket today:

@ol{
    @li{@b{Turing Recreational Center} Where we'll observe a few Game Modes on the first day of a new session.}
    @li{@b{Babbage University} Where we'll learn about the science of games in education.}
    @li{Lastly, we will jump forward in time, and revisit @b{Turing Recreational Center} to see a special Game Mode -- the last day's Game Jam.}
 }
