 @heading{3:50 pm -- 10 minutes until class start time}

 You return to Turing Recreational Center -- but the area looks different  The trees that were just starting to show bright green buds are now sporting a lush covering of leaves. Flowers have multiplied in the beds by the walkways. The air is significantly warmer: the last of the winter's chill fully banished. Spring has nearly shifted to Summer over the last 10 weeks since you were here last.

 You enter the Center and head straight to the Arts and Crafts room, where Ruby is setting up for the class.

 "Hello again!" Ruby says. "Glad you made it back for our Final Jam!"

 "Glad to be back."

 You offer to help set up, and Ruby hands you a bag of mice.

 "So, you are here to see a Jam," says Ruby. "You haven't seen a MetaCoders Jam yet, have you?"

 "Nope."

 "Well, I think this is going to be a great one -- this team has been working hard to prepare for it!"

 "What kind of prep do you have to do for a Final Jam?" You ask.

 "Everything we do from day one is to get ready for Final Jam. As I tell my students, Final Jam is the 'big game' our team is practicing for. Every class is like a sports practice for that big game -- all Story and Game Modes are helping us build the skills we need to be successful at Final Jam."

 "Okay, but what exactly is a Final Jam? What do the students do?"

 "Right, that would help to know, wouldn't it?" Ruby laughs. "During Final Jam, students write a whole game or system, from scratch, in an hour or so. This Final Jam is a Game Jam; the students will be building a video game. They are awarded points based on the complexity of their game. "

 "Haven't they been writing games this whole time? During Game Mode?"

 "Yes," Ruby continues, "we've been practicing! Just like drills in basketball practice, the Game Modes are time to learn and practice different snippets of code -- ways to customize our game. There are many supports -- scaffolding is the official educational term -- as students learn new things. In Final Jam we remove that scaffolding, and the students take everything they have learned, and their own creative imaginations, and build a game using only what they remember. No hints!"

 "Wow," you say. "And the kids can do that? Without any hints?"

 "Alright, I may have exaggerated a little. We remove a lot of that scaffolding, sometimes all of it! But, as always, coaches are trying to hit that balance of challenging but achievable. We don't want our students to be overwhelmed with -- oh what is that term the prof uses..."

 "Cognitive load?" You offer.

 "Yes! That's right, you were probably just talking to him about flow state, right?" You nod and Ruby goes on, "In Final Jam we really want to get those students into that flow state for a lot longer than we usually have Game Modes. So our job as coaches is to balance the cognitive load we are asking our students to undertake so they get into that sweet spot between 'boring' and 'that's impossible, I give up.'"

 Two students come in the room. They are talking excitedly and when they see Ruby, one of them says: "Coach Ruby! I have a question about Game Jam!"

 "One moment, Samiya." Ruby turns back to you. "I will try to check in with you more than I did last time; there are lots of little ways that a coach can tweak a Final Jam to make it the best for a particular team so I'll try to loop you in on those choices I am making along the way. While I am getting started here, check this out..."

 Ruby hands you a piece of paper:

 @card{
  @card-body{
   @b{Goals of a MetaCoders Final Jam:}
   @ul{
    @li{Today is @b{different} and @b{more exciting} than any other class day.}
    @li{Students @b{code a game}.}
    @li{Students feel @b{proud} and @b{accomplished} regarding what did in the Jam.}
   }
    
   Rules, hints, resources and other scaffolding can, and should, be adjusted to accommodate the needs of a particular team of students; just remember the goals. Adding resources for students can make a potentially frustrating Final Jam into a success! However, too much help can undermine a feeling of actual accomplishment. It's all about balance!
    @br
   Coach energy is a big element in making this day different from others â€“ if you are excited, pumped, focused and wowed by student work, the students will be too.
  }
 }
 
 You know the deal by now -- you can't keep this paper. You fold it back up and put it next to Ruby's belongings.

 @heading{4:00 pm}

 The last of the students are trickling in. You see Ruby send attendance to HQ before calling the stragglers over to the table in the front where everyone else is already seated.

 "How can tell me what we are doing today?" Ruby asks. All the students raise their hands immediately. "All together?" She prompts.

 "Game Jam!"

 "Of course! Who's excited?" The students cheer. Ruby continues: "Me too! I will go over the rules, then we will do a quick refresher on crafters. After that we will start the Jam!"

 "As we practiced last week, we will be working with a partner." The students immediately start chatting and moving, obviously trying to partner up with their 1st choice. Ruby stops them: "Hold up! Listen first. I will let you pick your partner @i{but} before you just grab your BFF I want you to take a moment to think @i{is this person going to distract me? Is this the partnership that is best for Game Jam, not just the most fun for me?} Because I reserve the right to swap people around if I think there are better choices that should have been made. Okay?"

 Once Ruby gets the students' agreement, she releases them to pair up. She counts down from 15, then asks everyone to sit next to their partner. Ruby reviews the pairings.

 "Hm... Robert and Carlos: do you think you will be able to focus?"

 "We will!" Says Carlos, as both boys nod eagerly.

 "Alright, but if I start seeing you two getting off topic again, I will split you up." Ruby says.

 Ruby gives each pair an index card and a marker and instucts them to come up with a team name for the Jam. She sets the timer for 2 minutes, and when it beeps, gathers back the markers and continues explaining the Final Game Jam.

 Twice, one of the returning students you remember from last time interrupts to tell Ruby that they "didn't do that last Game Jam." Ruby responds that different Final Jams can have different rules, and that @i{these} are the rules of the Jam @i{this} time.

 Ruby outlines the rules:

 @ul{
  @li{Every pair will have 1 computer. One partner will type at a time. Every 3 minutes when the timer beeps, they will "swap drivers" and change who is typing.}
  @li{The "non-driving" partner is still part of the coding process, working with their teammate to look for bugs, make creative choices and sometimes checking out resources.}
  @li{Every pair will be given two hexagonal cards as inspiration; it is not required to use the inspirate, it is optional help if anyone needs help getting started. These cards are to remain code-side down, unless a hint is purchased. }
  @li{Various resources/hints will be available -- some for free and some cost "dollars:" paper money that each student has. The price for any resource can change at anytime Ruby wishes.}
  @li{Games will be scored at the end of the Jam. Scores are dependant on the complexity and amount of working code. Ruby doesn't explain the exact formula just yet. The whole class score will be added up and compared to other MetaCoders classes in the past!}
  @li{Pairs can also get bonus points for exceptional teamwork, practicing good coding habits, or creativity.}
  @li{Games must @i{run} by the end of the Jam to get any points.} 
 }

 Ruby asks students to hold on to questions for now, as she goes on to explain the different "resources:"

 @ul{
  @li{A lone computer against the wall is designated as the @b{sprite computer} -- holding a list of all available characters to put in the game. Ruby says that this is free to access (at least in the beginning!)}
  @li{At any time, a pair can purchase a @b{flip} -- access to the code-side of one of their two cards or, for a small additional fee, Ruby will choose another card that she believes will help a partnership achieve whatever they are attempting to code at that time. Ruby sets the price for a flip at 5 "dollars" to start, and 7 "dollars" for a coach-selected card.}
 }

 Ruby hints at the potential for other resources to be "released" later in the Jam. For now, she writes up the two options, and their curent prices, on the white board. Then, Ruby sets the timer for 3 minutes and announces that she will take up to 3 minutes of questions.

 You notice that Ruby listens to each question carefully, but doesn't always answer them right out. Sometimes she refers to a rule she already reviewed, sometimes she responds with a question of her own, sometimes she just shrugs with a "I guess we'll find out!" It reminds you of Professor Istoria's frustrating way of avoiding questions. The kids @i{are} a bit frustrated by Ruby's ambiguity, you note, but also intriged and even entertained.

 @heading{4:12 pm}

 When the timer beeps, Ruby finishes not-answering a question before moving on. She spends the next 10 minutes reviewing some code -- the "crafter" she must have been referring to earlier. When she is done, there is a significant chunk of code written on the white board, much of it in the handwritting of the students she called on to help. She erases this code -- to the dramatized dismay of some of the students.

 @heading{4:25 pm}

 "Alright, are we ready?" Ruby asks the students, whose mixed responses range from confident cheers to nervous maybes. One student, you remember his name is Jayden, squeals "no," but his grinning face and bouncing in place betray his excitement.

 "You all can do this. The Game Jam will be about 45 minutes today -- that's a long time! In one moment I am going to transform from Coach Ruby into Judge Ruby -- that means I won't be helping you all out -- at least not for free! Coach Ruby is going to leave you with one super valuable piece of advice though. Want to hear it?" The students obviously do. "Here it is: @i{start small and test often}. Write one little bit of code at a time and test, test, test every line you write. Start small, test often." Ruby writes those words in big letters on the white board.

 "Ready? Set...." Ruby holds the timer in the air, finger poised over the start button. "Start Jammin'!"

 Each pair runs to a computer. Ruby gives each team two of the code cards, reminding the students that these are for ispiration if they need it, and not to look at the code on the opposite side unless they buy a flip. After every pair has the cards, Ruby watches for another moment, before walking over to you.

 "Phew!" Ruby sighs and smiles. "Getting them pumped up in the beginning is a lot, but it's fun! Do you have any questions so far?"

 "A few," you say. "You said you customize the Jam for each group. What did do particularly for this group?"

 "Good question. For starters, I don't always review code before a Jam. But if there is anything a particular group has struggled with -- crafters are tricky, but for some groups it is how to define something, or even parentheses -- I make time for a quick review. Sometimes I even leave a guide or code outline up on the whiteboard for the students to reference. But this team is too advanced for that; we've been working for 10 weeks and there are quite a few returners."

 "Do you always do Final Jam in partners?" You ask.

 "Almost always, yes. It really increases every student's likelihood for success -- not only does each partner have different fluencies they bring to the table, but even the act of having to communicate about the code helps them catch bugs and solve issues that neither student would have caught solo."

 "Also builds those teamwork and leadership skills that MetaCoders emphasizes, too." You guess.

 "Absolutely."

 "What about the resources and rules? At the very least, I imagine you change the 'prices' of those resources."

 "Yeah, I definitely do that. I try to hit a point that I think will encourage students to try to debug without help first. But I always give myself that option of changing the price; that's been a life saver!" Ruby laughs. "If I see students relying on a resource too much, I'll hike up the price. And when we are in the final stretch, if I am seeing struggling pairs, I will lower the prices or make special resources available."

 Ruby invites you to join as she makes a lap around the room, checking in to see how each pair is getting started. When the timer in her hand beeps, she instucts everyone to switch drivers before restarting the timer.

 @heading{4:30pm}

 You observe Ruby as she goes group to group, offering words of encouragement, creative inspiration, and rule reminders. She find yourself comparing her to a cheerleader as you notice her high, positive energy.  Her energy peaks as Ruby places a gold star sticker on a team's index card, annoucing loudly that team 'Club Of Dangerously Evil Rabbits (C.O.D.E.R)' has earned a bonus point for being really creative in designing a story behind their game.

 A moment later, Isabel raises her hand and Ruby goes over to where Isabel is sitting with her partner, Samiya.

 "There's a bug and we don't know how to fix it," says Isabel.

 Ruby takes a look at the pair's computer, and, after a moment, says: "Hmmm, well I think I see your problem. @i{But} since I am Judge Ruby, not Coach Ruby, I can't be giving you the answers! But I can remind you of a few things you already know:"

 Ruby encourages the students to check common places for errors -- like parentheses and spelling errors -- and lists a few de-bugging techniques they have used in previous classes -- like reading the error out loud or looking for the red-highlighted text.

 "If you are still stuck in a minute or two, remember you can always purchase a card flip!" Ruby says, pointing at the resources list on the whiteboard.

  Ruby continues to circle the room, and has gives out two more bonus point stickers: one to team "Ravenclaw" for excellent teamwork and the other to "The Llama Coders" (Isabel and Samiya) for working really hard to debug their code without help!

 @heading{4:40pm}

 Ruby continues to address student questions, not by giving them answers, but offering advice or general reminders. In one case, Carlos and Robert's code was giving an error and Ruby did go in and fix something on their computer. You ask why she fixed this bug and Ruby replies:

 "That error had to do with our tech on the computer, just a minor compile conflict. I know how to fix that one, since I have seen it a handful of times in my own coding. Since that's not related to their code, I don't expect the students to know how to fix that! So I step in there."

 "I will also sometimes swap a computer out if there is something going on that I don't understand." Ruby continues. Then I will also help the students catch up with the code they have written so far, since they are starting from scratch in the middle of the Jam."

 "That make sense," you say.

 Just then, Jayden and his partner, Skylar, raise their hands. You follow Ruby to their table.

 "How can I help you..." Ruby checks their index card for their team name, "'BEST TEAM OF WINNERS'?"

 "We want to buy a flip!" Jayden says.

 "Alrighty, would you like to flip one of your cards, pick another card, or get my advice for an extra two dollars?"

 "We know what card we want," says Skylar.

 Ruby pulls the deck from the pocket of her coach hoodie, helping the students find the card they are looking for. They pick out one of the cards on the crafters that Ruby reviewed with the group earlier. Ruby trades the card for 5 of their fake dollars.

 "You now have this for the rest of the Jam," says Ruby. "Good luck!"

 @heading{4:45pm}

 Ruby announces to the whole class that they are approximately halfway through the Game Jam. She sets a timer on her phone for 15 minutes -- "I will give them a 10 minute warning when this goes off," Ruby explains.

 "Are Final Jams always 45 minutes long?" You ask, remembering a question you had earlier.

 "No, it really depends on how much time you have in the whole class, and how much time you use in the beginning for rules, prep and review." Ruby says. "I aim for at least 30 minutes, but if I have a short class of only one hour and an especially nervous group that needs extra review, I have gone as short as 20 minutes."

 "And that still works?" You ask.

 "Absolutely! There isn't a benchmark for the amount of coding that the students need to complete, they just should code something and feel acomplished by what they did!" Ruby says.

 "Right." You remember the 3 goals of Final Jam.

 "You also want to make sure you leave time for scoring and awarding of prizes at the end of class," Ruby says. "That can depend on the number of students you have because it takes longer with bigger groups. I am leaving myself 20 minutes today for this group. So I check the time when all the rules and reviewing is done, subtract 20 minutes from the end of class and Voila! That's how long my Jam is that day."

 The coach timer beeps. "Switch drivers!" Ruby announces loudly to the class. "Everyone switch drivers!"

 @heading{5:00pm}

 Ruby's phone timer goes off. Before she announces the 10 minutes warning, she turns back to you:

 "Entering the final stretch now! You want to focus on getting all teams' games running. I might lower the cost of a resource, or add in a 'call in the coach' option -- when students can buy my help for 2 minutes or so to debug their code with them. They only get points for running games, so I want to help them get to that goal."

 Ruby gives the students the 10 minute warning and the excitement in the room jumps up another notch.

 You find yourself noticing, or trying to guess, the state of flow for each student. You and Ruby both notice a student that seems particularly "out of flow" at the same time. You follow Ruby over to the student in question.

 Ruby checks in with Rahul, who is sitting silently next to his partner, Daniela, not working with her or even paying attention as she types away. With some gentle prodding from Ruby, Rahul reveals that he and Daniela have not been agreeing on which sprites to add to their game, and Daniela just changed all @i{his} characters in the code to what @i{she} wanted them to be. Ruby pauses Daniela's coding to talk to the pair:

 "Working with a partner can be difficult," says Ruby, "especially when we disagree. Daniela, did you change the code you two wrote together without discussing it with Rahul?" Daniela nods. "Is that the kind of teamwork we strive for in this class? Was that 'Energizing your Team?'" Ruby asks, quoting the Code of Awesomeness.

 "No, but it wasn't fair, he didn't ask @i{me} what @i{I} wanted when @i{he} was coding!"

 And so it went back and forth for a few minutes. Ruby didn't spend too much time on who did or didn't do what, but asked questions and instructed the students on a compromise: Rahul got to pick some of the characters, and Daniela the others. She also brought them both over to the 'sprite computer' and looked through the list together until she found one that she could get both students moderately excited about. Ruby sent the pair back to their computer together with the decision that this would be their main player.

 You congratulate Ruby on her handling of the tough situation.

 "When the kids work in pairs there will always be disagreements. It's not a problem, it's part of the learning experience -- it's not like adults don't ever disagree with their coworkers, friends, or spouses!" Ruby laughs.

 Another timer goes off and Ruby announces "Five minutes remaining: makes sure you are testing your games and fixing any bugs now!"

 @heading{5:07pm}

 "Three minutes left! If you code isn't running, raise your hand. I may be able to offer some advice or a special resource discount..."

 Ruby hops from pair to pair, giving last minute bonus points and words of advice. Some of the students are confident and chatting excitedly about the game they have coded, and some others are more nervous -- stuck on a last bug or wanting to finish up one last addition to their game. Ruby has an encouraging word for each of them.

 @heading{5:10pm}

 When the last timer goes off, Ruby does one more lap around the room, making sure everyone has a running game on their screen. Many of the students want to keep coding, but Ruby is firm that the time is up. She does spend one extra minute with team "Ravenclaw" to help them get their game running.

 "Congratulations everyone!" Ruby says, leading the group in a round of applause. "You all did amazing work! Ready to count up your points and see our class total?"

 Ruby leads the students through a scoring process that involves counting up parentheses and keywords, dividing the total and adding bonus points. Ruby asks you to help check the student's math. You notice that everyone ends up with a sum between 15 and 30.

 When every team has an approved total, Ruby adds up everyone's total and writes it on the board. She congratulates the whole group on one of the largest point totals she has seen! The students are estatic!

 @heading{5:20pm}

 Ruby hands out "dollars" according to the points each pair earned. Ruby give each pair a small tidy-up task -- collecting the computer mice, collecting the hexagonal cards, erasing the whiteboard, shutting down the computers -- while she takes out a small collection of toys she dubs the "market." When each pair proves they have completed their task, Ruby lets them come to the market and use their fake money to buy a toy or two. After which, she send them to sit at one of the tables.

 After the last student was encouraged to make their pick from the market, Ruby joins everyone at the table.

 "Congratulations again, on a Game Jam well Jammed, coders!" Ruby says. "I have a final badge for you -- this is the Game Jam Badge that you only get for completing a Survival Language Game Jam. It shows all other MetaCoders that you have taken on this challenge and emerged triumphant!"

 Ruby bestows a badge on each student, with as much pomp and circumstance the limited time allows.
