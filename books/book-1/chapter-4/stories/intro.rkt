  Welcome back to Metapolis!

  In this chapter we will be learning more about coding education as it works in universities and how we see coders work "in the real world."
 
  Today we will travel to:

  @ol{
    @li{@b{Babbage University} Where we'll observe a class of senior computer science students learning git.}
    @li{@b{TechSquared} ........}
    @li{@b{Coder Cafe} to catch up with Yu and learn how to create a @i{coach bio}.}
    }

  Also, if you complete the assessment, you'll also be uploading your @i{own} coach bio to Github -- which will allow us (at MetaCoders HQ) to incorporate your bio into our main site at metacoders.org and virtually introduce you to all other MetaCoders around the world!
