@paras{
  Welcome to Metapolis!  As you can probably see by looking around, Metapolis is not a real city.  Rather, it is a city created with code -- a model of reality.  

  We created Metapolis as the imaginary site for your MetaCoders coach training for a few reasons:

  @ol{
    @li{Human brains organize information better when it is organized spatially -- and we actually want you to remember this stuff!  So as you traverse the city of Metapolis, one click at a time, we hope you'll imagine the places and characters you'll meet.}
    @li{Being a MetaCoders coach is about more than just being a coach.  It's about being part of a coding ecosystem that includes coaches, students, parents, technology coordinators, curriculum developers, and more.  Whether it's Metapolis or the real city that you're currently living in, we never want you to lose sight of the big picture.} 
    @li{It's fun!}
  }

  In Metapolis, there are several coaches and several places where coaches and students gather to learn the arts of coding: Babbage University, Hopper Library, and Lovelace Elementary -- just to name a few.  

  Your training will involve several chapters. Each chapter will include a journey through Metapolis, glimpsing first-hand inside the classrooms of the city, and even inside the minds of the students and coaches therein. We will travel through time and space to experience all the aspects of being a MetaCoders Coach.

  Thank you for being here with us.  We hope you enjoy your stay.

  In this chapter, we are visiting Metapolis in early May -- Spring has sprung in Metapolis, and everywhere you look there are flowers, new life, and people outside, enjoying the warm, sunny days.

  We will stop at a few places today:

  @ul{
    @li{@b{Babbage University}, where we'll observe a smoothly-running coding classroom, with an excellent coach -- like the one you (one day) will be.}
    @li{@b{Hopper Library}, where we'll observe another classroom and we'll meet a long-time student who is also training to be a coach.}
    @li{@b{Metapolis Welcome Center} (where we are now) -- where we'll wrap up and help you prepare for this chapter's assessment.}
  }
