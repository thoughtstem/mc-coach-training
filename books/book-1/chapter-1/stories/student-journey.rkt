  As you walk into Hopper Library, you see two pictures hanging on the wall.  One is a photograph of a piece of paper with a moth taped to it.  The plaque beneath it simply reads, "a literal computer bug."

  The other is a portrait of Grace Hopper, according to its corresponding plaque, an American computer scientist who rose to the ranks of United States Navy rear admiral.

  Her plaque lists several contributions -- inventing the first compiler, inventing the COBOL programming language, and for literally "debugging" the Mark II computer by pulling a moth out of it.

  You continue into Hopper Library and, with the help of a friendly librarian, find your way to the room in the back where MetaCoders holds a weekly coding class.

  You peer in and instantly recognize that the class is in Story Mode.  But this time, the person telling the story doesn't look like a coach -- he looks like a teenager.  He is wearing a MetaCoders hoodie that reads "Junior Coach" on the back.  You half-expect him to be telling the story of Grace Hopper and the moth -- but as you listen, you realize that he talking about himself.

  "I started at MetaCoders three years ago, in the last city I lived." he says.  "I still remember my first class.  I was nervous.  I was a bit awkward.  I was there because I wanted to learn how to code computer games.  How many of you joined this class because you want to learn to code games?"

  The majority of the seven students raise their hands.  One kid starts to joke that he's here because he wants to learn how to be a hacker so he can --

  "Good!" says the junior coach, directing the attention back to himself. "You'll definitely learn how to make games.  And you'll definitely learn what 'hacking' means.  But I want you to know that I learned a lot more than just coding in my three years at MetaCoders.  Does anyone know what leadership skills are?"

  Most of the kids raise their hands.  The kid who wants to be a hacker stands up and starts to "helpfully" demonstrate what it means to be a leader by giving a mock speech: "Four score and seven years ago--"  

  This time the actual coach, whose nametag reads "Ruby", steps in.  "Jonah, sit down please" she says.  The other students, who had been starting to giggle, quiet down.  "That's strike one. Remember what we discussed last week."  Then to the class, "How many points of focus there should be during Story Mode?"  

  Several of the kids raise their hands -- as does Jonah.  Ruby calls on another student, who answers "one." 

  "Correct!" says Ruby.  "Who should have that focus right now?"

  There is some confusion, as some of the students suggest the junior coach and some suggest Ruby.

  "That was a tricky one! I have the focus right now. But, that's about to change as I pass things back over to Mateo to finish his story!" Ruby steps aside.

   "Does anyone know what leadership skills are?" the junior coach, Mateo, asks again.  He gets a couple answers from the students, before he continues with his story.  "Since I want to work in video game development company, I am going to have to work with other coders, as a teammate and as leader. By learning more than just coding, but these leadership skills, and now practicing them as a junior coach, I'm becoming an even better programmer and future game developer! Do any of you think you might want to be a junior coach in a few years?"

   Most of the students, including Jonah, raise their hands.

   "Nice!" Ruby cuts in.  "Learning to code and learning to coach go hand in hand.  When you're learning to code, you @b{always} have to coach at least one person.  Who is that?"
  
   Jonah's hand shoots up.  

   "Jonah?" she says.

   "Yourself?" he says.

   "Correct!" she says.  "MetaCoders coaches study coding and also how people's brains learn to code.  That's an important skill even if you're just coaching yourself.  Everyone here has a brain right?"
 
    The kids laugh, and Ruby uses the shift in energy to transition the class to Game Mode. After she has explained the game, Ruby hands the reins back over to Mateo to run the game, then comes over to join you.

    "Welcome," says Ruby. "I'm glad you got to see Mateo's story!" 

    "Yeah," you say.  "He did a great job.  I'm getting a little nervous about all these stories -- everyone seems to tell them so well and easily."

    "Maybe now we do," Ruby says, "but it took practice for all of us!  Mateo worked really hard on his story and storytelling skills to get to the point where he could tell this story today.  I was pretty unsure about the whole thing myself, but now I find that I usually end up telling stories from my own life that get across the value I want to discuss, rather than one of the stories MetaCoders provide."

    "Like what?" you ask.  Ruby thinks for a moment before she answers.

    "When I have a group that is struggling with resiliency and grit, I like to tell them a story about my first NaNoWrMo -- National Novel Writing Month-"

    "But I thought you had to talk about coding..." you say.

    "Nope!" Ruby says. "I have a lot of coding stories now, but when I started as a coach, I was very new to all that. I told a lot of stories about my experiences as a writer.  I still use those stories, because the skills students learn here go far beyond a computer coding context and I want students to be thinking about that."

    "That makes sense." You say. "Sorry I interrupted; what is the NaNo... Novel... Month story you were talking about?"

    "Don't worry about it!" Ruby continues, "Several years ago, I was just starting to seriously about becoming a novelist, but I kept writing the first page and getting stuck.  I would get really discouraged that it wasn't perfect and quit.  I didn't have any grit.  But one year, I decided I was going to try National Novel Writing Month. Participants start a novel on November 1st and finish with a 50,000-word book on the 30th. I knew the only way I was going to get past the first page is if I just did it, and didn't ask myself whether or not it was good or bad until December 1st.  I didn't even look back at anything I wrote; I just kept writing to reach that word count!  By the end of the month I @b{hated} that story -- but I @b{loved} that I had actually finished it.  At the end, I finally had a novel: even if it wasn't a good one."

   You nod.  "I guess your stories can also just be about life and learning." 

   "Right.  MetaCoders pride ourselves that what students learn with us is more than how to code: it's how to @b{learn}. Metacognition, you know!"

   "I'm sorry, I am not sure I know-"  You start to say.

   "Right. We are still in Chapter One; I forgot,"  Ruby says.  "You'll learn more about metacognition later. Long story short, metacognition is thinking about your own brain and how it learns new things.  Very meta."

   You are still a bit confused, but as Ruby turns back to the class, you start to realize that MetaCoders has a consistent set of values -- ones that pertain in equal parts to the learning of coding and the science of learning.  You figure that if these kids can be getting it, you should be able to too.
