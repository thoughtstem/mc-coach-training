  You're back!  If you did the right thing, your progress bar should now be full.  If not, you may have missed something.  But we're not here to micromanage your tours through Metapolis.   

  Next up is the self-assessment.  Since this will be your first official assessment, we'll remind you of a few things:

  @ol{
    @li{If you don't know how to start an assessment, you missed something in the previous chapter (the Intro Chapter).  Go back and learn how to install the software and run a deck of flashcards.}
    @li{Assessments are optional unless you are getting an official MetaCoders coach certification -- in which case they are mandatory.}
    @li{Submitting an assessment involves recording a video of your screen and audio while you have a flashcard deck running.
      @ul{
         @li{The flashcard deck should be visible on screen at all times.}
         @li{All flashcards have a timer.  Maybe 10 seconds for a simple vocabulary question.  A few (in the later chapters) are 10 minutes and ask you to code something on screen.}
         @li{If the flashcard asks you to navigate somewhere in your browser or code something onscreen.  Do so.  And narrate what you are doing verbally.}
         @li{If the flashcard asks you to discuss something or tell a story: simply speak.  We'll listen to the audio and assess your verbal answers for correctness and (as your training progresses) for vocal intonation and storytelling skill.}
      } 
    }
   @li{The flashcards will not be a surprise.  You may study the fronts and backs as much as you wish before submitting your video.}
  }

  As is always the case at MetaCoders, we never ask anyone to do anything without knowing @b{why}.  So if you happen to be nervous about recording yourself and happen to be asking "But why can't I just write my answers down and send them in?"  The answer is simple: to be truely fluent, timing matters.  When you step into a classroom, we need you to not just "know stuff."  We need you do be deeply @b{fluent} in the things we're teaching you; so the information is ready for you when you need it.

  Traditional education usually assesses you on what you are able to write down and turn in.  But this means that students often never get assessed on how quickly or effortlessly you are able to recall that information.  As we'll discuss in more detail in later chapters, that's part of the definition of "fluency" -- an ability to recall things quickly and effortlessly.  

  We hold our coding coaches to a high standard -- both as coders and as coaches.  That's why we assess fluency instead of knowledge.  Knowledge is slow; fluency is fast.

  But that's why we also let you see the answers before you take the test, and we let you take as many practice tests as you want.  We blur the line between test and learning.  You'll learn even more from the act of studying for the assessments than you will from reading through the materials and watching our videos.   

  On that note, you should know one more thing.  Assessments are sometimes tricky in two ways (so do not be alarmed when you come across cards of these types):

  @ul{
    @li{@b{Foreshadowing Cards} Not every flashcard will have been answered in the chapter's materials.  When we do this, the card is designed to be both easy enough for you to learn by looking at the back.  And we expect you to look at the back and memorize the answer.  These cards always foreshadow something that you will learn more deeply in a future chapter.  There are two coding flashcards in this chapter's assessment that are of this sort.}
    @li{@b{Flashback Cards} Not all of the stuff you learn in a chapter will have a flashcard in that chapter's assessment.  Often, a later chapter's assessment will assess you on content from a previous chapter.  For example, there are no flashcards in this chapter's assessment about Game Mode and Story Mode -- but you can bet there will be in chapters coming up.}
  }

  In cases like these, the flashcards are not broken.  We've just designed them in a very particular way -- a way that we genuinely believe will make you more fluent faster.  

  Ultimately, that's what we care about at MetaCoders -- fluent coaches that train fluent students.  We've seen it happen.  We know you can do it.  But we need your help.  If at any time you need ours, don't hesitate to email us at training@"@"metacoders.org.  But also, don't be the kind of student who raises your hand (via email) every time you get stuck.  Practice grit.  Practice problem-solving.

  Become the most fluent coder/coach you can.  Do it for yourself -- because coding is one of the most sought-after skills on this planet today.  Do it for your students for the same reason.

  We're lucky to have you.  Train hard so that your students will be lucky to have you too.
