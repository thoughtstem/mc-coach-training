  Welcome back to Metapolis!

  This is it -- in this chapter you will be learning the first language you are going to teach, so make sure you know what language that is! There is only one short stop with @b{Yu} at @b{Coder Cafe} and a couple study guides because a lot of the work in this chapter is you working with the code!

  You will get some tips on how to teach yourself, where to find the tools, and how to know when you are ready.

  Have fun, and good luck!
