  Welcome back to Metapolis!

  In this Chapter, we will help you learn how to learn the first language you will be coaching! Unlike the student's in your class, you have to structure your @i{own} learning -- there won't be a Coding Coach over your shoulder guiding you through stories and games!

  But guess what? You still have access to all those stories and games! You can check out all games, stories and classmaps at any time @(link-to "coaches/maps" "here").

  First, some scientific background to make you a better language learner and coach!

  We will visit:

  @ol{
    @li{@b{Babbage University} Where we'll discuss the neuroscience of learning to code.}
    @li{Then we will visit our good friend, Yu, at @b{Coder Cafe} where we'll get stating learning a new programming language!}
 }
