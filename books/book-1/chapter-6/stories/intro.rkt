@paras{
  Welcome back to Metapolis!

  In this Chapter, you will be laying the groundwork for Chapter 8, where you will be learning  a whole new language: the first language you will be coaching!  This may (or may not) feel like a big leap, so we'll get some science background on what it takes to learn a language and a head start on some coding concepts that will put us on the right foot for Chapter 8.

  We will visit:

  @ol{
    @li{@b{Babbage University} Where we'll discuss the neuroscience of learning to code.}
    @li{Then we will visit our good friend, Yu, at @b{Coder Cafe} where we will see some of the code you may practice later!}
 }
