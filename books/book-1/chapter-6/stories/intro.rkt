  Welcome back to Metapolis!

  In this chapter, we'll be visiting a research lab at Babbage University -- where we'll discuss the neuroscience of learning to code, and learning languages in general.

  We'll also visit a mid-sized tech company called TechSquared, where we'll discuss what it's like to be a software engineer.

  Then, we'll stop by a local elementary school to see why certain scientific results never see the light of day in classrooms.

  Finally, we'll begin gearing up for your "final exam" -- to learn a brand new programming language you've never learned before.
