 @heading{4:55 -- five minutes before class start time}

 "Long time no see!"  Ruby says when you enter the dojo.  You offer to help as Ruby sets up the last of a couple folding tables and a handful of chairs.

 "This is an odd place to hold a coding class."  You say.

 Ruby shrugs.  "Not really.  MetaCoders partners with the whole community.  Anywhere there is a soace that can get to new students and areas of the community is a place for us!"

 The bell to the dojo rings as a student walks in.  You see the a person who must be the boy's father wave to Ruby before hopping back into the car at the curb.

 "Hey Ben!"  Ruby says.  She turns to you, reminding you:  "Class starts the moment the first student arrives, but that doesn't mean you need to drop everything you are doing to entertain them!  This is the seventh week of this class so these students know the start-class routines that help us transition into classtime."

 Ruby continues the last of set up, as you take a step back to observe.  Ben puts his backpack down to the left of the door.  He goes over to Ruby's equipment takes a quick look before asking:

 "Coach Ruby, where are the nametags?"

 "I haven't gotten to them yet,"  Ruby says.  "Do you want to set them out for me?"

 "Yeah!"

 Ruby instructs Ben on where to find the nametags, while placing the last two computers on the table.  He finds them easily and begins to lay them out, one by one, on one of the tables.

 The bell dings again. Another student enters.

 "Hi Liam!  How are you today?"  Ruby asks.

 "Good."  Liam says as he tosses a sweatshirt towards Ben's bag.  It lands several feet away, towards the middle of the room.

 "Woah woah, Liam."  Ruby says.  "Can you try that again?  You know that's not where we put our belongings."

 Liam picks up his sweatshirt and drops it against the wall, next to Ben's bag.

 "Thank you, Liam.  Would you like to start handing out mice?"  Ruby offers the bag of mice to Liam who starts his task.

 Over the next five minutes, seven more students arrive. Each one puts any bags, water bottles, or sweatshirts against the wall by the door.  Ruby offers the student who arrives after Liam the task of helping him with the mice, but she asks if she can eat her snack instead.  The next two students help set up, but by the time the rest of the students arrive, all jobs are complete and all students take a seat by the mats in the corner.  When one student jumps on top of the mats, the others remind her to sit on the floor.  Ruby thanks them for remembering the rule.

 "We'll have more time to chat about the start-class routine later, but I just want to say that most classes I run have different ones."  Ruby says.  "It depends on the room, where the students are coming from, even the particular team of students and what kind of energy they tend to arrive with. In many ways, what the routine @i{is} doesn't really matter -- rather, it's about just @i{having} a routine at all."

 Ruby joins the students in the corner.  You settle into a seat in the corner and watch. You note how Ruby starts with a Story Mode and, several minutes later, you pay particular attention to how she transitions into a Game Mode:

 
 @heading{5:15pm}

 "Wow,"  Ruby says,  "I am so impressed with how you all have progressed in our story discussions!  You all have such insightful comments and are doing a much better job of @i{listening} to each other's comments as well."

 "Alrighty.  We are about to shift into Game Mode."  The students perk up at Ruby's words, and start shifting in their seats.  "We are going to be playing a new game called @i{Code Carousel} so listen to all my instructions and wait for me to tell you to start before you go anywhere!"

 Ruby explains the goal of the game, and the first several steps.  Ruby partners up the students, writes some coding prompts on the board, has the students repeat her instructions back to her, all before pressing start on her coach timer and releasing the students to rush over the the computers.

 Ruby comes over to where you are seated.  "Any questions so far?"

 "Can you tell me a bit more about the start of class?  You said that the routine doesn't really matter, just that there is one.  What do you mean?"

 "So, with the Story Mode to Game Mode transition, there is a clear structure."  Ruby says.  "What @i{exactly} I say obviously depends on the game, but I know I am going to start by @b{A}nnouncing the transition and reinforcing listening -- 'Wait until I say go' or 'Stay and listen until I tell you to start' -- then I will @b{B}uild tension as I tell them the first several steps to get them started, then I will @b{C}hange space -- 'releasing' them to start the game.  This is always the same; it's a simple as ABC."

 "But a starting routine might vary course-to-course. It definitely varies coach-to-coach!"  Ruby says.  "I always include putting belongings down somewhere specific; I hate tripping over everyone's stuff by their tables.  But other coaches don't care as much about that.  They might always have students start on the computers, reviewing what they remember from last week.  Or always have a snack break.  Or a group chat about what the students did over the weekend.  I have used all these as part of different class routines."

 "How do you know what to do, when you have so many choices?" You ask.

 "You start to find your own favorites and things that work.  The simplest routine to start with is... wait I think I still have it written down somewhere..."

 Ruby gets a card from her bag and hands it to you triumphantly:

 @card{
     @card-body{
       @card-text{
         A Simple Starting Class Routine:

         @ul{
             @li{Have a specific location for students to go and @b{sit}.}
             @li{Talk to them about their day (@b{Story Mode!})}
             @li{Take @b{attendance} as each student arrives.  Submit attendance and start with classmap when ready.}}}
       }
     }

 "Super simple, right?"  Says Ruby.  "But the key to a great routine has less to do with the content of that routine and everything to do with @i{consistency}.  Just do it every day, and you are succeeding!"

 @heading{5:30pm}

 A little while later, Ruby is ready to transistion back into story mode.  She has given the students a 5 minute, 3, minute, 1 minute and even a 30 second warning.  After this last warning, she turns back to you:

 "So this is the trickiest transition, as you remember.  I am going to reverse those steps from earlier: I'll @b{C}all attention so I can @b{C}hange the space, then I will help them @b{B}ring down their energy from the game mode and the flow state that I interrupted, then I will @b{A}dvance into the Story Mode."

 You watch Ruby as she gets the class attention by calling out one of the Codes: "Energize the Team!"

 "Teamwork makes the dream work!" Most of the students call back.

 "That was almost everyone!"  Ruby says.  "We can do better than that, though. ENERGIZE THE TEAM."

 "TEAMWORK MAKES THE DREAM WORK!"  All of the student call back this time.

 "That's more like it!  Please close your computers and any code you were working on, and join me in the Story Corner."

 You notice the mild resistance from the students are recall your own interrupted flow state from the ealier Tetris game and emphathize.

 Ruby, however, starts counting down. "5, 4..."

 The students leap into action.

 By the time Ruby reaches 0, the students are in the 'story corner,' some of them only barely making it.  Ruby congratulates the students and asks a few of them to share their experiences in that game.  After hearing from a few, Ruby leads the whole group in three deep breaths.

 "Wonderful."  Ruby says.  "Now I'd like to tell you a story..."

 @hr

 The class continues.  You notice how Ruby handles the one or two times the students resist a transition.  A younger girl named Hana tears up when Ruby asks her to leave her computer after one Game Mode.  Ruby empathizes with Hana's frustration, points out the amazing work she did do and reminds her of all the progress she has made. Ruby tells Hana that they have to move on, but asks her if she would let Ruby tell the group about the game she was creating.  She leads Hana to the group -- the whole exchange takes maybe a minute.  Hana is still sniffling, but by the time Ruby is telling the group about her unicorn and llama game, Hana is grinning again and telling everyone that it was a unicorn, llama and @i{cow} game.

 You note how Ruby transitions every time -- always following those ABCs/CBAs. One time, she releases the students from a Story into a Game Mode in small groups defined by the colors on their tee shirts ("if you have green on your shirt, go find a computer...").  Another time, transitioning into a Story Mode from a particularly exciting Game, Ruby leads the students through quick stretch  and shake-out.
 
 @heading{6:25pm}

 Time flies, and after copious time warnings, Ruby has each student help clean up.  Some get the mice, others, the computers.  Some even fold up the chairs and tables.  Then, she collects all the student back to the Story Corner to wrap up with a quick one-word reflection from each student.  Then, Ruby leaves the students seated and goes to the door.  A handful of parents await.  Ruby has to remind one student to wait until she calls their name, but all others wait patiently, chattering amoungst themselves about the last game.

 "Liam,"  Ruby calls.  Liam jumps up from the group, grabs his sweatshirt by the door and runs to his mom, just outside the door.

 "Who are you picking up?" says Ruby to the next parent.  Then calls: "Hana!"

 One by one, or in some cases two by two, Ruby calls the names of the students who each get their belongings before heading out the door.

 After the last student leaves, Ruby turns to you with a smile.

 "Now, the most important thing to remember about the end of class is a safe, organized dismissal."  Ruby says.  "I've had students who want to run out the door as soon as they see their parent, or students who want to leave @i{now}, even though their ride isn't arrived yet.  That's why I like to put them overe there,"  Ruby points to the far Story Corner, where the students where waiting,  "and release them one by one."

 "Do you happen to have a card..."

 "A card for the simplest ending-class transition?"  Ruby asks.  She pulls a card from her pocket:

 @card{
     @card-body{
       @card-text{
         A Simple Ending Class Routine:

         @ul{
             @li{Have a specific location for students to go and @b{sit}.}
             @li{Call for the student when their adult has arrived.}}}
       }}

 "Wait-- that's exactly what you did." You say.

 Ruby shrugs.  "I don't have to put my own twist on @i{everything}."

 You help Ruby finish up the last of the tidying up before heading out into the early summer evening.

 @;As you pass Babbage's Analytical Engine on the way out, you stop to admire the mechanical complexities of the machine.  You find yourself thinking about classrooms as machines too -- built not from gears and rods, but from human brains and bodies.  The Analytical Engine has its modes and transitions too, no doubt; but it's impossible to tell what they are simply by looking at the contraption.  But you suspect that no matter how complex Babbage's machine is, it can't compare to the complexities of an 'educational machine' constructed out of a coach, a bunch of computers, and coding students.  The punchcards hanging in a plastic baggy on the wall remind you of classmaps -- programs, but for a more predictable machine.
