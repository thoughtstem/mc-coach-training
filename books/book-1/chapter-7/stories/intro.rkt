  Welcome back to Metapolis!

  In this chapter we will focus on @b{classmaps}.  You'll learn how to find and read the classmaps that we provide.  This will immediately enable you to run a smooth coding class -- and it will begin to prepare you to create your own classmaps in the future.

  There's only one stop: @b{Bruce's House}.

  We are visiting Bruce before his first day at @b{Lovelace Elementary} (which we saw in Chapter 3!).  This brings us to mid March in Metapolis, so bring a jacket to fend off the last of the winter chill!
