You park in the parking lot of Kick Butt Martial Arts, a karate
dojo that has trouble filling classes during weekdays at certain hours.
MetaCoders rents the space for a coding class for junior high students.  

As you walk in, you see six kids, shoes off, in beanbag chairs on the mats.
Ruby is at the "front" of the room holding a whiteboard marker and running
Story Mode. There is code written on the wall-length mirror behind her.

You quietly take a place on the benches near the door, unnoticed.

These kids are older, and you can tell that Ruby is using more sophisticated
language.  In fact, she's talking to them like adults.
