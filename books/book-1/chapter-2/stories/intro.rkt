  Welcome back to Metapolis!

  In this chapter, we'll be following Yu, who (much like you) is going through the MetaCoders coach training for the first time.

  Yu will be creating their Github account and their very first repo.  So will you.  But at MetaCoders we never ask anyone to do something without a clear understanding of @b{why}.

  So in this chapter, the one stop is @b{Coder Cafe} where Yu is currently sitting... waiting for you.  Yu will give a quick overview of Git and Github as well as that very important @b{why}.  Go on, get coding!
